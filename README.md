# 🔮 Transformer-Based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

This project implements a Transformer Encoder model in PyTorch for multivariate time series forecasting. By leveraging self-attention and positional encoding, it effectively captures temporal dependencies across multiple features and provides accurate multi-step predictions — useful for finance, energy, or biosignal analysis.

## 🧠 Highlights

- Implements a **Transformer Encoder** architecture with **positional encoding** for multivariate time series data.
- Includes a **PyTorch training pipeline**, **sliding window dataset builder**, and **visual evaluation** with Matplotlib.
- Fully modular design with clean separation between model, training, evaluation, and data loading.
